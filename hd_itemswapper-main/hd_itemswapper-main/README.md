# hd_itemswapper

>This is a simple easily configurable Converter/Combiner script for RedM!

## Features
- When the player uses an item set in the converter part of the config it removes that item, and adds new items you set!
- Creates a crafting/combining system using Warmenu!
- Crafting system can remove as many items as you want, and in return give you new items you set!
- Easy to translate via Config.Languages in the config.lua file!
- Uses vorp_inputs to allow you to craft mulitple items at once!

## How it works
- For the converter just double click(use) the set item in your inventory. It will then remove that item and add the new ones!
- For the crafting/combining system just type the command in. The default is 'hd_combiner' you can change it in the config.lua file!

## Why use it
