# Boats

#### Description
This is a basic boating script for RedM servers using the [VORP framework](https://github.com/VORPCORE). Boats can be bought, sold and transferred through shops. There are 6 shops configured, more shop locations may be added using the `config.lua` file.

#### Features
- Buy, sell and transfer boats through the boat shops
- Cash or gold may be used for payments
- Shop hours may be set individually for each shop or disabled to allow the shop to remain open
- Boats are available to use in the shop where purchased
- Boats can be transferred to other shops by menu (configurable transfer fee) or by driving boat to the new shop and returning it there.
- Shop blips are colored and changeable per shop location
- Blips can change color reflecting if shop is open or closed
- Shop access can be limited by job and jobgrade
- Boats can be returned at the shop location via prompt or remotely using the in-boat menu after parking/beaching the boat somewhere
- Config setting to prevent the spawning of NPC boats
- Boats can be driven across the map without sinking

#### Configuration
Settings can be changed in the `config.lua` file. Here is an example of one shop:
```lua
    lagras = {
        shopName = "Lagras Boats", -- Name of Shop on Menu
        location = "lagras", -- DON'T CHANGE / Used for Location in Database

        blipAllowed = true, -- Turns Blips On / Off
        blipName = "Lagras Boats", -- Name of the Blip on the Map
        blipSprite = 2005921736, -- 2005921736 = Canoe / -1018164873 = Tugboat
        blipColorOpen = "BLIP_MODIFIER_MP_COLOR_32", -- Shop Open - Blip Colors Shown Below
